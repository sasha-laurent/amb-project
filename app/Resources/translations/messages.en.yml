    presentation_paragraph_4: 'AMB proposes, more precisely, a platform for constructing personalized presentations (showing, exhibition, visit and reading tour, course...) in an interactive and intuitive manner. It is intended for mediators whose objective is to create content (professors, curators...), and for receptors, whose goal is to be informed, discover, learn, explore, etc. (general public, students, visitors, spectators...). '
    presentation_paragraph_5: 'AMP may give grounds to numerous educational and cultural paradigms, as, for instance : MOOCs, SPOCs, active pedagogy projects, inverse class sessions, classical lectures, projects of visitor-centered digital museology, dynamically composed tailored shows, communication operations, etc. '
